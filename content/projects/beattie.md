I created and host a website for the [Beattie Union Cemetery](http://beattieunioncemetery.org/). It lists all of their current grave markers, as well as pictures of each gravestone in the cemetery. It is a great resource for genealogists and family members to find information about family members in the cemetery.

It was built using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP framework.

Website graphical design was provided by [Heather Pekrul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherpekrul/)
