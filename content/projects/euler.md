As personal programming practice, I've solved over 100 problems on the Project Euler website. I encourage anyone interested in programming to give them a try!

I have a private repository containing my solutions, so feel free to contact me if you'd like to peruse the code. I keep it private to help maintain the mystery of solving those problems yourself before seeing solutions!
