This project was undertaken to replace the old K-State Engineering Flowchart system with a new system using modern web technologies. I implemented several major new features, including an advising scheduler used by [K-State CS](http://schedule.cs.ksu.edu) for several years, and a flowchart creator to help students manage their class schedules. This project was continued by several students as a senior project, and then another K-State faculty member to hopefully achieve the goal of replacing the old system.

The project was primarily written using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP framework, and many supporting tools.
