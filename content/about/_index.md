## My Background

I grew up on a farm in rural northeast Kansas, and learned the value of hard work there and as a member of organizations such as 4-H and FFA. I also enjoyed actively volunteering in the community.

I attended Kansas State University and earned by B.S. degree in Computer Science in 2008. During that time I worked as a student in the Information and Educational Technology (IET) unit of the K-State Department of Communications in the College of Agriculture. After graduating, I was hired as a full-time Computer Support Specialist to supervise the helpdesk and provide direct support to that department and other units housed in Umberger Hall.

In 2012 I started working on a M.S. degree in Computer Science, which brought me back to the Computer Science Department. Upon recommendation of a friend, I was hired as an Instructor and Academic Advisor in the K-State Computer Science Department in 2013. I taught there for several years, but left in 2017 to move to the Kansas City area. While there, I finished my M.S. degree in 2018.

In 2018 I was re-hired at K-State Computer Science as an Instructor, this time focused on developing and teaching a new set of online courses targeted at non-Computer Science majors. Through that work, I helped develop the core parts of our Computational Core program, Cyber Pipeline program, and the basis of the new Integrated Computer Science degree program as well as a new undergraduate certificate in Computer Science. I also help with new teacher training courses used for a graduate certificate in Education focused on Computer Science Education. 

I am also continuing my research as I work on a Ph.D. in Computer Science focused on Computer Science education. 

Outside of work, I enjoy volunteering with the 4-H program during the summer as a photography judge. I am also a member of the All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in Kansas City. I enjoy reading, cooking, programming, and playing board games (if that isn't obvious from the rest of the content on this site).
