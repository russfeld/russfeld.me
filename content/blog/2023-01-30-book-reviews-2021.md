Another year gone by, another long list of books that I've read. This one is going to be pretty short and sweet - mostly just a list of what I've read so I (or any other intrepid readers wondering what I've read) can keep track. 

<!--more-->

Enough of me rambling - onward to the books!

# Fiction

### _**[The Stormlight Archive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CBP9DY)**_ by Brandon Sanderson

This year I read the existing 4 books in The Stormlight Archive series, and it is a _monster_ of a series to read. Brandon Sanderson earns all of the hype here, and this is worth a read by _anyone_ who loves large fantasy worlds like _Lord of the Rings_ or _Wheel of Time_. 

### _**[This is How You Lose the Time War](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNG496J)**_ by Amal El-mohtar and Max Gladstone

Two nearly omnipotent beings are small pawns in a war spanning space and time itself, and they start leaving each other notes that slowly turn into love letters. This book is amazing, and honestly made me go seek out more by the same authors.

### _**[The Craft Sequence](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUG3DLM)**_ by Max Gladstone

A great blend of a law drama and a rich fantasy world with lots of recurring characters and a story that is told out of order (like _Star Wars_ you end up starting in the middle and learning more of the backstory later on). 

### _**[Teixcalaan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R2N2SMH)**_ by Arkady Martine

This two-book series has already landed a ton of award wins and nominations. A great story about memories being shared and copied between people who are given the same role over time, leading to lots of interesting internal conversations and information warfare.

### _**[Spellslinger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C2GR6ZZ?)**_ by Sebastien de Castell

A great series about a young mage who doesn't really excel at magic learning how to use his wits, his friends, and a talking squirrel cat to eventually save the world from destruction. The audiobooks for this series were fantastic.

### _**[Tyrant's Throne](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TS264GD/)**_ by Sebastien de Castell

Likewise, the last book in the _Greatcoats_ series delivered a bombastic (and predictable melancholy) end to a gripping series. This one should almost be required reading for anyone who loves _The Three Mustketeers_. 

### _**[The House of Always](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GJQPRHW)**_ by Jenn Lyons

The fourth book of the _Chorus of Dragons_ series did a great job expanding the world, bringing together the characters, and setting the stage for the showdown in the eventual finale in a cliffhanger for the ages. There is a reason that these books now live in hardback on my permanent shelf - I recommend the series so highly!

### _**[The Galaxy, and the Ground Within](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088RDCLQ4)**_ by Becky Chambers

The fourth book in the _Wayfarers_ series is easily my favorite. The story of an interstellar truck stop full of interesting characters just trying to live their lives and find a little comfort away from home. Becky Chambers is definitely on my "must read" list from now on.

### _**[To Sleep in a Sea of Stars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081D7ZSTL)**_ by Christopher Paolini

I have yet to read his _Eragon_ series, but Christopher Paolini's first adventure into science fiction and fantasy created a rich world and compelling characters. I can't wait to read more!

### _**[American Gods](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004YW4L5K)**_ by Neil Gaiman

A neat retelling of many characters from mythology present in our modern world - Gaiman is a must read.

### _**[The Midnight Library](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085BVSXS9/)**_ by Matt Haig

A great novel exploring how many different ways your life could have gone. 

### _**[Project Hail Mary](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FHBV4ZX)**_ by Andy Weir

Andy Weir returns to space for this novel, and honestly I love the characterization in this book. 

### _**[Ready Player Two](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BYWH6CS)**_ by Ernest Cline

The original was good if overrated, but the sequel just feels like a friend making you watch their favorite old movies and making sure you get all the inside jokes and obscure trivia references it contains. 

### _**[The Goblin Emperor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FO6NPIO)**_ by Katherine Addison

An outsider has to assume the throne and finds themselves at the mercy of court politics. It was good, but thus far I've not really felt the need to read the sequels. 

### _**[Night Watch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W912Q0/)**_ by Terry Pratchett

Another year, another _Discworld_ novel. Terry Pratchett never disappoints. 

# Non-Fiction

### _**[Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R8QSXYB/)**_ by Matt Parker

Matt Parker's YouTube channel is great, and the book lives up to the hype. 

### _**[Anthro-Vision: A New Way to See in Business and Life](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LDXLMDQ)**_ by Gillian Tett

An anthropologist looks at the modern world. 

### _**[Drunk: How we Wipped, Danced, and Stumbled our Way to Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KQ18XLF)**_ by Edward Slingerland

How alcohol shaped our culture and our lives today.
