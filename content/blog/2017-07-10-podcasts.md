After the 2016 election, I made a [pledge](/blog/political-discourse) to stay more informed in the world. Seven months later, I am trying to do just that. Using my ears!

Over the past several months, I've found my daily routine shifting to include more and more time for listening to podcasts. I listen in the shower, while I'm doing chores, when I'm running, or when I'm commuting around town. Couple that with the amazing [NPR One](http://one.npr.org/) app, and there is really no excuse for not having something interesting to listen to.

Here are a few of my favorites (in no particular order):

### [Up First by NPR](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first)<br>
A great start to every weekday, in just 12 minutes they cover all the latest news. It usually lasts just long enough for me to get ready in the morning, and usually the NPR One app immediately follows this by the latest hourly news from NPR and KCUR, our local station.

### [NPR Politics](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast)<br>
I started listening to this podcast almost a year ago, before the election. Twice each week, the NPR team reviews the latest political news. It is a great way to stay up to date.

### [FiveThirtyEight Politics by ESPN](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/)<br>
The podcast from Nate Silver and his group, they cover politics from a data-driven point of view looking at polling and trends. I also like how their group feels like they lean a bit right of where NPR is (which, honestly, is probably more toward the center than actually right of center).

### [1A from WAMU](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510316/1a)<br>
1A is a daily news podcast that tackles one big story each day. I especially like their Friday news roundup, as they spend the last half of the podcast on international news.

### [Planet Money by NPR](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money)<br>
Not just another boring podcast about money, this podcast dives deep into our world and economy to find great stories about how our world works.

### [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! by NPR](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/344098539/wait-wait-don-t-tell-me)<br>
The classic NPR comedy news show, now in podcast form!

### [Ask Me Another by NPR](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510299/ask-me-another)<br>
For pub-quiz experts, a weekly show dedicated to trivia and puzzles (and a bonus of Jonathan Coulton).

Of course, there are many others out there! Any favorites? Let me know!
