Here we are! It's the end of 2019, and now's a great time to look back and reflect on the books I've read (or listened to) in the past 12 months. Once again I've finished 50 titles (at least by some methods of counting), so let's get to it!

<!--more-->

As I've read more and more, I've found that I watch less and less TV, and somewhat fewer movies as well. Honestly, if I'm not working, cooking, or playing video games, I'm very likely to be found with my Kindle in hand during my downtime. I've found reading to be truly a relaxing and rewarding pastime. So, as always, here's my book reviews for all of the books I read during 2019. Since I've read so many, I figured I'd break them up a bit into arbitrary sections.

As always, I still *highly* recommend the  [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-paperwhite) as my e-reader of choice. [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/amazon-kindle-is-the-best-ebook-reader/) agrees. There is even a new version that is waterproof! It's still on my wishlist!
