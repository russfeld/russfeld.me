Here we are! It's the end of 2019, and now's a great time to look back and reflect on the books I've read (or listened to) in the past 12 months. Once again I've finished 50 titles (at least by some methods of counting), so let's get to it!

<!--more-->

As I've read more and more, I've found that I watch less and less TV, and somewhat fewer movies as well. Honestly, if I'm not working, cooking, or playing video games, I'm very likely to be found with my Kindle in hand during my downtime. I've found reading to be truly a relaxing and rewarding pastime. So, as always, here's my book reviews for all of the books I read during 2019. Since I've read so many, I figured I'd break them up a bit into arbitrary sections.

As always, I still *highly* recommend the  [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-paperwhite) as my e-reader of choice. [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/amazon-kindle-is-the-best-ebook-reader/) agrees. There is even a new version that is waterproof! It's still on my wishlist!

# Sequels

<hr>

For one thing, 2019 was definitely a year full of sequels. So, I've chosen to group them all here. You can go back to my previous reviews to find more information about each series, but these are my general thoughts for each sequel!

### _**[Interference](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LF69D8T/) (Semiosis Duology)**_ by Sue Burke

The _Semiosis Duology_ has really been an interesting read, because unlike a lot of the sci-fi I read the main character is truly a unique organism (spoilers - it's a tree). This story takes place quite a while after the first, and gives a really unique view into how the human's culture has changed over the years. They also have to deal with yet another unknown species! Part sci-fi, part study of human society in isolation, but a very fun book to read. Thanks to my aunt for the suggestion!

### _**[Starsight](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NCQ6RJG/) (Sequel to Skyward)**_ by Brandon Sanderson

Let's see... Brandon Sanderson. Check. Sci-fi. Check. Strong characters. Check. Unexpected adventures. Check. _Starsight_ picks up right where _Skyward_ left off, following our main character out into the larger world and peeling back all of the layers. I love how Sanderson always is able to slowly direct his readers toward the bigger picture, but each time he does you know that he's been thinking at that level since day one. Nothing feels retconned in. While I always get frustrated when I see Sanderson working on literally anything outside of the Cosmere, it's these little stories that show his depth as a writer.

### _**[The Name of All Things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LF69HCG/) (A Chorus of Dragons)**_ by Jenn Lyons

No, this is _NOT_ the long awaited book from Patrick Rothfuss (seriously, still waiting on that one too). This is the second entry in the _A Chorus of Dragons_ series by Jenn Lyons, and it is a doozy. I ended up speeding through the first book again over Thanksgiving week before I read this one, and I'm so glad I did. This story is chock full of interesting characters, and the interweaving "story within a story within a book within a book" structure is so exquisitely done that it is hard to put down. I always found myself wanting to read just one more chapter! I really hope that this series starts getting some publicity soon - it is really great! If you like _Wheel of Time_, you'll probably like this, too.

### _**[Knights Shadow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TV1V7SW/) (The Greatcoats)**_ by Sebastien de Castell

Once again, Miriam and I slowly worked through another of _The Greatcoats_ books as an audiobook during our many hours on the road. Clocking in at over 25 hours, this book is long, but the story never feels like it bogs down. In fact, it moves so fast that it is hard to believe how far the story went in just one short book. The writing is great, the characters are memorable, and the performance of the narrator is fantastic. I really can't wait to finish this series, even though it may take us another couple of years worth of road trips.

### _**[All Systems Red](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYZ8X5C/) (The Murderbot Diaries)**_ by Martha Wells

Another year, another entry in the popular _Murderbot_ series. We can follow along as our favorite rogue security bot explores the world on his own while figuring out how to stay undercover in a human world. It is a great read, even though it is a little short. If you can pick this one up on sale, I recommend it, but the base price of nearly $10 for just a few hundred pages seems high to me. There is a novel coming in 2020, so it's a great time to get caught up on _Murderbot_!

### _**[Record of a Spaceborn Few](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BFJCB9) (Wayfarers)**_ by Becky Chambers

The last entry of the _Wayfarers_ series is a standalone novel exploring cultural and societal clashes in space. Told from many different points of view, this book is yet another example of how Becky Chambers is really able to bring a fresh and progressive look at how humans would fare in space. It maybe isn't all doom and gloom as some modern sci-fi would like us to think!

### _**[Out of Spite, Out of Mind](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4RB91S/) (Magic 2.0)**_ by Scott Meyer
### _**[The Vexed Generation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081LMMW5Z/) (Magic 2.0)**_ by Scott Meyer

Finally, I was able to finish the most recent two entries in the _Magic 2.0_ series. I really recommend the audiobooks for these. They are a fun and lighthearted listen, and the characterizations are so well done that you don't even have to think about who is talking. Short version - magic is real, but handled by computers. Imagine a bunch of computer nerds figure it out, time travel to medieval Europe to pass themselves off as wizards, and then discover they aren't the only ones to have that idea. Of course, hijinks ensues, but it is replete with pop culture references, nerdy humor, dungeons and dragons tropes, and more. I think my background in programming really helped me appreciate some of the more subtle humor in the books, but there is something for everyone. The anti-villain Jimmy is one of the most interesting and hilarious characters I've seen in quite a while. Seriously, I hope someone is optioning these for a movie or TV series!

## Dresden Files

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B000PDYVQ6&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_uSDsEbPVERZ6R" ></iframe>

### _**[Dead Beat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PDYVQ6)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Proven Guilty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC0SBY)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[White Knight](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4LH3S)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Small Favor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UZNS0O)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Turn Coat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V6P124)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Changes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030DHPAW)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Ghost Story](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4XI0Y)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Cold Days](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090UOJAI)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Skin Game](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HUVUSZ4)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Side Jobs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043RSIV4)**_ by Jim Butcher

Whew, did I really read **that** many _Dresden Files_ books this year? I guess I did. Chicago's very own practicing wizard and private investigator finds himself becoming slowly and more firmly pulled into the larger conflicts between different factions in his world. You can definitely feel that the story takes on a much larger scope after the first few books, and toward the end it go so good that I was reading each book in under a week. The next book is finally on the slate for 2020, and I'm glad I'm all caught up and ready to go.

# Science Fiction & Fantasy

<hr>

Of course, one of the biggest genres on my reading list is always sci-fi and fantasy. I covered quite a few series this year, so I'll group them all together here in one easy to read place.

## Hyperion Cantos

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B004G60EHS&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_2NDsEb9NW1AN2" ></iframe>

### _**[Hyperion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004G60EHS)**_ by Dan Simmons
### _**[The Fall of Hyperion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G60FWM)**_ by Dan Simmons

My friend Charlie recommended this series to me in late 2018, and it was definitely a classic that I had missed. The first book follows seven travelers as they tell their respective life stories all culminating on how they ended up on this trip that apparently leads to nothing but failure and probable death. Each story is unique and well described - the book could also be seven short stories combined into one overarching narrative.

The sequel continues the story, taking you on a mind-bending journey through space and time that is at times heartbreaking and exhilarating. I decided to end the series there due to lackluster reviews of the last two books, but it is definitely on my list for something I'd come back to in the future.

## Gentleman Bastards

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B000JMKNJ2&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_t0DsEb5BAYX5A" ></iframe>

### _**[The Lies of Locke Lamora](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMKNJ2/)**_ by Scott Lynch
### _**[Red Seas Under Red Skies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UDNBS0)**_ by Scott Lynch
### _**[The Republic of Thieves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4WLIM)**_ by Scott Lynch

This one was a recommendation from Dan, my major professor, and it was definitely a highlight of my summer. Part _Three Musketeers_, part _Ocean's 11_, this story follows one Locke Lamora and his band of thieves, the _Gentleman Bastards_ as they generally eke out a living by swindling those who can afford to have their purses lightened a bit. Of course, it is never that simple, and they quickly find themselves the targets of more than a few people who'd like to see them gone.

From there, the story takes so many twists and turns it is hard to count. By the third book, they are trying to rig an election. (Seriously, it makes sense when you get there). I read the first one, then bought the audiobook for the other two so I could listen to them while I worked around the house.
