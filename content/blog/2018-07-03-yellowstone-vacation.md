Well, I also intended to write this article much sooner after the fact, but it didn't happen. So, here's what I can recall, and hopefully it will serve as a great little chronicle of our vacation to Yellowstone and the adventures we had.

## Day 1 - Headed North

On our way north to the Badlands, we stopped in Sioux City, Iowa to check out the [Brightside Cafe](https://siouxcitybrightside.com/). It was a nice little spot to grab food and relax after being in the car for several hours. While we were there, we decided to check out the nearby [Sioux City Public Museum](http://www.siouxcitymuseum.org/sioux-city-public-museum) - a completely free museum full of interesting history from the area. Apparently Gateway Computers was founded nearby, so they even had an exhibit of some cool old tech that made it an interesting find in the midwest.

Most of the rest of the day was filled with lots of driving, as well as the first book in the Bobiverse series: _[We are Legion (We Are Bob)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L082SCI/)_.

Eventually, we arrived at our destination - [Circle View Guest Ranch](https://www.circleviewranch.com/). This is absolutely in a perfect location for folks travelling to Badlands National Park, and they have definitely taken advantage of it by building a large bed & breakfast to accommodate guests. We met several fellow travelers there and enjoyed a nice, peaceful night on a farm. As you can well imagine, I felt right at home. Miriam did a great job capturing some pictures of the area on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkaVr6EgeSj/).

## Day 2 - Badlands National Park

The second day of our trip began with a delicious country breakfast served by Amy and her family. It really was as close to home as I could have ever imagined to find on the road. I could really see myself hosting a B&B at some point in my life, and if I did, that is what I'd be serving for breakfast.

From there, we headed into [Badlands National Park](https://www.nps.gov/badl/index.htm), the first major stop on our trip. As always, our first stop was to check out the visitor center, where we found some really unique architecture in the picnic bench shelters.
