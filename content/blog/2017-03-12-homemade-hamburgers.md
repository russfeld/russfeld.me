Culinary Adventures #1 - The Perfect Homemade Hamburger.

I've been cooking for most of my life (shout out to [4-H](http://4-h.org/)), but only started taking it seriously about a year ago. Since then, anytime I go out to eat, I always find myself asking: "Can I make this myself?"

So, upon a visit to [BRGR](http://brgrkitchen.com/) in Kansas City, I found myself pondering that very question. With a little help from J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt's book [The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TG24C34), I decided to give it a try.

Doesn't that look delicious? (Hint: it totally was!)

The recipes for everything I made are below:  
[Brioche Burger Buns]({{ site.url }}/recipes/brioche-burger-buns/)  
[Smashburgers]({{ site.url }}/recipes/smashburgers/)  
[Twice-Fried Fries]({{ site.url }}/recipes/twice-fried-fries/)  
[Refrigerator Pickles]({{ site.url }}/recipes/refrigerator-pickles/)  
[Homemade Mayonnaise]({{ site.url }}/recipes/homemade-mayonnaise/)  

This was a really fun project, and I will definitely do this again in the future.
