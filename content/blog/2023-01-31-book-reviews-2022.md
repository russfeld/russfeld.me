Finally getting caught up on tracking the books I read in 2022. Like last year, this will be short and sweet. I'm hoping to switch to tracking books as I read them instead of these once-yearly posts. We'll see how well I do!

Enough of me rambling - onward to the books!

# Fiction

### _**[Codex Alera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0841YPYWT)**_ by Jim Butcher

After many years on my "to read list" I finally dove into Jim Butcher's other big series. This series does a great job of following a character from humble, unsure beginnings to confidence at the height of his power and responsibility. Unfortunately I found the ultimate ending a bit underwhelming given the setup, but don't let that discourage you from the adventure of getting there.

### _**[The Final Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HQC8B6Z)**_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky

This series was quite the interesting surprise. It feels very similar to _The Expanse_ at this point, with the universe once again at risk of destruction. The last book is due in 2023. 

### _**[Monk & Robot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HH86QFL)**_ by Becky Chambers

Ahh, this series is like a warm, refreshing cup of tea and a quiet friend to share it with. Becky Chambers manages to write both quaint and soul-searching stories in the same book.

### _**[The Green Bone Saga](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08561RN43)**_ by Fonda Lee

Fonda Lee does a great job of mixing mafia stories with kung-fu and a very eastern aesthetic into one of the most gripping stories I've read in a long time. The characters feel so real, and you stay with them through most of their lives as they grow, mature, and come to regret some earlier choices and stand by others, regardless of the consequences. 

### _**[The Locked Tomb](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YZK34P7)**_ by Tamsyn Muir

A recommendation from a friend - the first book is absolutely dripping with swagger and character due to the titular Gideon's voice being the primary one. Unfortunately, I felt books two and three strayed from this a bit, though the story they tell is still interesting. I can't wait for the fourth book due out in a year or so just to see where it ends.

### _**[The Discord of Gods](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HPM6XM2)**_ by Jenn Lyons

The stellar conclusion to the _Chorus of Dragons_ series does not disappoint. This is really one for the ages, and I'm still sad that this series doesn't seem to be getting the attention I think it deserves.

### _**[Light from Uncommon Stars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QGJDSCK)**_ by Ryka Aoki

Wow - this book tells such a compelling story that keeps unfolding, layer by layer, until the very end changes everything once again. I love the fact that the main character is able to be true to themselves and their world. 

### _**[The Kaiju Preservation Society](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0927B1P8L)**_ by John Scalzi

Scalzi once again puts toghther a story with heart and humor, as is his usual style. 

### _**[Grand Theft Astro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QJ99FTN)**_ by Scott Meyer

The first book of Scott Meyer's that I've read since _Magic 2.0_ - it was interesting but I'm not sure it really worked quite as well as his previous series, but I'd read more. 

### _**[Legends & Lattes: A Novel of High Fantasy and Low Stakes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3755RV9)**_ by Travis Baldree

This was a great listen on a long road trip, being only 8 hours or so in length. A warm and cozy story with low stakes and lovable characters. I will never eat a cinnamon roll again without thinking of a rat. 

### _**[Cytonic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093P86W32)**_ by Brandon Sanderson

The third book in the _Skyward_ series was a bit divisive, and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about the change in tone and direction for the story. We'll see how the fourth book wraps things up, due in late 2023.

### _**[Leviathan Falls](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Y8LBCLH/)**_ by James S. A. Corey

The final book in _The Expanse_ lived up to the hype and wrapped up many of the loose threads in the ongoing story. 

### _**[Klara and the Sun](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B7V6CQ8)**_ by Kazuo Ishiguro

A very intersting story of an android that is purchased to be friends with a sick child who tries to save her by calling on the power of the sun. This one tugs at your heart pretty hard.

### _**[Equal Rites](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W9393Y)**_ by Terry Pratchett

I should have read this sooner - a great story supporting women in a men's world, in this case being a wizard!

### _**[Tattle of the Linguist Mages](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0927D791J/)**_ by Scotto Moore

Meh. Felt kinda like _Ready Player One_ without the retro callbacks. I finished it to see the ending, but wasn't really gripped by it.

# Nonfiction

### _**[The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091Q9VCP4)**_ by Dave Grohl

Stories and anecdotes from Dave Grohl's long career in music and on the road. The audiobook is amazing since you can hear all these stories in his own voice.
