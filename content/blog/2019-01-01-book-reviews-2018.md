Another year, another long list of books. This year was definitely a banner year - over 50 books! Read on to find out what I thought about each of a wide variety of books I read this year.

<!--more-->

As I've read more and more, I've found that I watch less and less TV, and somewhat fewer movies as well. Honestly, if I'm not working, cooking, or playing video games, I'm very likely to be found with my Kindle in hand during my downtime. I've found reading to be truly a relaxing and rewarding pastime. So, as always, here's my book reviews for all of the books I read during 2018. Since I've read so many, I figured I'd break them up a bit into arbitrary sections.

Before I do that, I yet again *highly* recommend the  [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-paperwhite) as my e-reader of choice. [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/amazon-kindle-is-the-best-ebook-reader/) agrees. There is even a new version that is waterproof! It's on my wishlist!

# Book Club Picks

One of the major changes in my life in the past couple of years was joining the [All Souls Unitarian Universalist](http://allsoulskc.org/) church in Kansas City. (Maybe I'll take the time to write about that in a future post.) We joined a small book club with other young adults in the church, and read two fantastic books together. The discussions were always fascinating, and I definitely expanded my horizons by adding these two books to my list.

## Thug life

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B01M0614T9&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_JdzlCb3W6JRJE" ></iframe>

### _**[The Hate U Give](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0614T9/)**_ by Angie Thomas

This book was definitely making the rounds this year, and was K-State's common book for the 2018-2019 school year. Honestly, there's very little I can say about this book beyond what you've probably already heard in the media and online. It is a very provocative and daring story about a young girl caught between the worlds of two different cultures and the issues with police violence against minorities. It really makes you think about your own views and biases, and is honestly a damn good story. I could hardly put it down while I was reading it, and I think it'll be a classic from our time for years to come. I have not seen the movie yet, but I'm definitely excited to see how this story fares on the big screen.

## Graphic novels can be deep

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B003H4VYQ0&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_oizlCbY0C7FFC" ></iframe>

### _**[American Born Chinese](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H4VYQ0/)**_ by Gene Luen Yang

This was our second book club pick, and was also really fascinating to read. It is a graphic novel that follows three different plotlines, all intertwined in very interesting and unique ways. It deals with what it is like to grow up different than your peers, all while dealing with negative stereotypes and a culture that is rich in history that is unknown to others you interact with. I feel that this is a must-read for any younger students wishing to expand their knowledge and grow into helpful citizens of our modern global culture. Even though this book is a graphic novel, the story itself still packs a punch, but it can be read in just a few short hours. I really enjoyed the time my wife and I spent reading this story together on our TV, doing all the silly voices we could for each character to make it come alive in our minds.

# Book Series

One of my major themes of 2018 was diving deep into several book series. While I didn't finish each book in several of these series, I did try to follow them as best I could through the books that interested me. For me, I think this was one of the more rewarding experiences, as it was fun to follow several different storylines through multiple books.

## Does John actually die?

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B007KJHGNI&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_VtzlCbFNPVHYR" ></iframe>

### _**[This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007KJHGNI/)**_ by David Wong
### _**[What the Hell Did I Just Read: A Novel of Cosmic Horror](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XC597WX/)**_ by David Wong

After enjoying the first book in this series a couple of years ago, I decided to finally go back and finish the series at the beginning of the year. As with the first book, the label "surreal horror comedy" is best used to describe these books. Though, to be totally honest, they've somewhat faded in my mind over the course of the year, though I remember being absolutely gripped by each book in the series while I was reading it. If you enjoyed the first book, it is definitely worth your time to complete the trilogy. They really are unique in many ways, and you won't regret reading them (at least, I don't _think_ you'll regret it...)

## Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B003G4W49C&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_WAzlCb69WRA7E" ></iframe>

### _**[Ender's Game](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G4W49C/)**_ by Orson Scott Card
### _**[Speaker for the Dead](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H4I4JU/)**_ by Orson Scott Card

One of my bucket list books for the year was _Ender's Game_. I've had so many friends and family recommend that book to me, or tell my how much they identified with that book when they first read it as a child or teen, and honestly, I can totally understand. This book really stands alone in science fiction as one of the classics, and it does such a good job of putting you in the shoes of a young boy who really thinks he is smarter and more well adjusted than everyone around him. Let's be honest for a second here, most of us feel that way from time to time, so it is a really interesting viewpoint.

_Speaker for the Dead_ continues the story in a very interesting way, dealing with cultural misunderstandings and the difficulty of understanding a culture (or species) totally unlike your own (see _Symbiosis_ below). Both of these books kept me interested for quite a bit, but after the second book I found that I wasn't quite enthralled enough to keep going in the series for now. It is definitely something on my list to revisit in the future.

## Read the books; avoid the movie

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B008J4PK86&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_0GzlCb94MH9DK" ></iframe>

### _**[Red Sparrow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008J4PK86/)**_ by Jason Matthews
### _**[Palace of Treason](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LD1OFN8/)**_ by Jason Matthews
### _**[The Kremlin's Candidate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HMXRXSY/)**_ by Jason Matthews

The next major series I read this year was the _Red Sparrow_ trilogy. Both my dad and my aunt were reading these books at the time I started, and I figured it'd be a great way to see what other's were reading and find out if I could relate. The descriptions of spy craft and the development of the characters in these novels was fascinating, especially for someone who spends more time reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. By the end of the first book, I was on the edge of my seat (or, at least, sitting up in bed) wondering what could possibly come next. These books were quite fascinating to read, and definitely expanded my horizons a bit beyond my usual genres.

A quick word about the movie, though: these books are great, and part of what makes them great is the pacing and description of the internal thoughts and actions of the characters as they work through their spy craft to lose tails, disguise their actions, and think about the ramifications of what they are doing. The movie, on the other hand, is missing many of these elements that made the book so unique. Instead, it focuses on the suspense, action, and titillation of the overall story without dealing with these minor details, much to the detriment of the experience. Don't get me wrong - I love Jennifer Lawrence, but honestly, the movies were not a great reflection of these novels. If you read the books first, prepare to be disappointed in the movie.

## A wizard in Chicago

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B001BPYD2O&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_bPzlCb0KJTCA8" ></iframe>

### _**[Fool Moon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BPYD2O/)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Grave Peril](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001650UDA/)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Summer Knight](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OCXG46/)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Death Masks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003X0AW6Q/)**_ by Jim Butcher
### _**[Blood Rites](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YKOX3E)**_ by Jim Butcher

Another major theme of this year's reading was constantly returning to the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. I read the first book last year, but moved on from that book to another series without continuing. This year, I tended to return to Dresden Files between series for a quick palette cleanser, and I honestly find them to be great reads by themselves. Each book builds on the previous, with that same unique voice from Dresden that many other books struggle to imitate. He has his own level of swagger, confidence, and pessimism that just reverberates throughout each story, and every book adds a new later to the work and backstory around Dresden, constantly making him a more interesting and integrated part of the larger story that is taking place outside of his influence.

While I won't say they are perfect, the Dresden Files books are always a dependable read, and I can't wait to keep moving through this series, as I hear they get better and better.

## If _Firefly_ was a book

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B00ZP64F28&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_qVzlCbTDPC9J2" ></iframe>

### _**[A Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP64F28/)**_ by Becky Chambers
### _**[A Close and Common Orbit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CNLOZ3G/)**_ by Becky Chambers
### _**[Record of a Spaceborn Few](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BFJCB9)**_ by Becky Chambers

So, I'll be honest here - I found this book from one of those online trivia things. You answer a few questions, it recommends a book. I can't even remember which one. I added it to my Kindle samples list, and eventually it percolated to the top and became my next read. I don't regret it in the least!

This series builds a unique world where several species and cultures live together in harmony, and it goes out of its way to show what inclusiveness would look like on a truly multi-species scale. Seriously, how do you deal with species that are multi-gendered, or even gender-fluid throughout their lives? What about a species where parenting is a serious profession, requiring experience in psychology, education, and more before you'd even be considered as a parent?

I've said a few times that the first book in this series is like _Firefly_, the novel, and I think it fits. There is a large cast of characters, all stuck together on the same ship for a year. How do they handle it? The second goes even deeper, dealing with existential issues such as the personal rights of a sentient AI, and a character that changes gender in the middle of the book. Never have I seen the pronouns "xy" and "xyr" used more appropriately in a book.

While I've yet to finish the third book in the series (it'll be the first book of 2019 for sure), I think these are an excellent read. If a high school wanted to expand discussions of race and gender (and other issues) into the realm of sci-fi, this would be a great place to start.

# Author Spotlight: John Scalzi

Another interesting thing that happened in 2018 was my infatuation with a new (to me) author, John Scalzi. During the year, I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting books, and both _The Collapsing Empire_ and _Redshirts_ were recommended to me several times. I decided to give them a try, and I was not disappointed. In fact, I ended up reading most of the books published by Scalzi throughout the year, and I'm itching for more.

## Star Trek is real?

<iframe type="text/html" width="175" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%; float:right; margin: 15px;" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B0079XPUOW&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_r9zlCbDD4WNN7" ></iframe>

### _**[Redshirts: A Novel with Three Codas](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0079XPUOW/)**_ by John Scalzi

The first major novel of Scalzi's that I'll cover here is _Redshirts_. If you've seen any of the early Star Trek series, you know exactly what is going on here. A captain and his crew goes on a mission, and inevitably, at least one redshirt ends up dying at some point. Without giving too much of the plot away, what if all the lowly redshirts on the ship are aware of this fact, and actively go out of their way to avoid going on missions with the select few who always seem to escape unharmed, somehow.

That's just a small start for how this book goes, but honestly, it was a hoot to read. My wife and I spent the better part of a year watching _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ while we were dating, and this was the perfect way to experience the larger fandom around a series as seminal as that. This book has many twists and turns, and it was definitely difficult to put down towards the end. You'll never be able to see Star Trek shows the same way again.

## I'm too old for this
