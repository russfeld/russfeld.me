One of my favorite pastimes is staring at dead trees and rocks (that we've somehow convinced to think by drawing on them and zapping them with lightning) and hallucinating stories while hearing voices of other people in my head while I do so. You might also call it reading.

<!--more-->

Here's what I read during 2023 through 2025! That was a bit of a chaotic period in my life (and in the world in general, iykyk), and unfortunately my ability to sit and read was somewhat hampered, so I wasn't as prolific as I had hoped I would be. Still, here's a good overview of what I read during that time.

# Fiction

### _**[Lords of Uncreation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BD4LZHKS)**_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky

An amazing end to _The Final Architecture_ series by Tchaikovsky. I would say this whole series quickly skyrocketed to one of my favorite science fiction trilogies to date, and quickly lead me to read even more of his work as you'll see below. Definitely check this one out!

### _**[The Lost Metal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MBS37W9)**_ by Brandon Sanderson

The last book in _Mistborn: Era 2_ from Sanderson was equal parts amazing and exciting, and I feel like this book is where the wholly connected world of _The Cosmere_ finally starts to take shape. It isn't quite the "Avengers, Assemble!" moment that _The Cosmere_ is slowly leading toward, but in this book we start to see a few of our favorite plot threads and characters coming together in new and interesting ways. 

### _**[Defiant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWHFWZMZ)**_ by Brandon Sanderson

The last book in the _Skyward_ series by Brandon Sanderson was also a major hit. I really think Brandon hit this one out of the park with great characters, a fun plot, and several major twists and turns that always seemed to be out of left field and yet totally sensible in context. I'm super excited to see what is coming next in the follow-up series, and feel like this might be the best contender for first Sanderson work to get an adaptation (please be an anime _crosses fingers_). 

### _**[Wind & Truth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPWQZNQB)**_ by Brandon Sanderson

Hoo boy, three books in a row that are all the end of a series by Sanderson? This is quite the transition period for a lot of the work that Sanderson has been doing, and I think _Wind & Truth_ is probably the quintessential book that shows that transition. It's differently structured, has a decidedly very divisive plot (some like it, some don't), and neatly wraps up many plot threads while still leaving even more dangling, with a purported decade-long wait before we even start getting answers. Still, I think _Wind & Truth_ does a great job capping off the front half of _The Stormlight Archive_ and represents a monumental achievement in fantasy. So, go read it!

### _**[Secret Projects](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRGNG6YC)**_ and _**[Hoid's Travails](https://www.amazon.com/Hoids-Travails/dp/B0F11YD12X/)**_ by Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah! There was also the whole _Year of Sanderson_ in here as well. Obviously I went to the Kickstarter and said "here, take my money" so I ended up with four (now five) amazingly detailed hardcover stories and whole closet full of trinkets, knick-knacks, and collectibles that I'll treasure for a long time. 

_Tress of the Emerald Sea_ was amazing. This is probably my new go-to for anyone wanting to explore Brandon Sanderson or fantasy stories in general. It is such an engaging and well-written story, and you appreciate it even more as you slowly discover the connections to the broader _Cosmere_ universe it based in.

_Yumi and the Nightmare Painter_ is similarly gorgeous to read and look at. This one is a bit deeper and more thought provoking than _Tress_ but still a very captivating story.

_The Sunlit Man_ is more closely related to the existing _Cosmere_ universe and really requires a bit of understanding to really appreciate it, but it does shine a light (heh) on one of the more interesting characters in that world.

_The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England_ was honestly a bit of a disappointment compared to where I imagined it going, which still means it was an _above average_ read given how good of a writer Sanderson is. It does include one of my favorite chapter titles of all time: "Wait. Did I Just Do a Colonialism?"

_Isles of the Emberdark_ Ok, you got me there. It's sitting on my shelf yet to be opened, but I wanted to make sure it got listed here. I have yet to read any of the stories in the _Cosmere_ set in this world, so I have a bit of catching up to do first. Then I'll read this one. I'm sure it'll be awesome. Ok? Ok. 

### _**[The Dispatcher Series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CH3HWSZ)**_ by John Scalzi

As always, John Scalzi hits on some nice, easy to read fiction that blends interesting characters and sharp plots with easy to read prose and witty dialog. These three novellas are great short reads that feel a bit like _Dresden_ but with a different twist. 

### _**[Starter Villain](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9KVXCQ6)**_ by John Scalzi

This was my beach read in 2024, and it was a great little novel to pick up. Again, Scalzi does a great job with a fun premise to make for an entertaining read.

### _**[Constituent Service](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DH9DK6DS)**_ by John Scalzi

Another short and sweet audiobook by Scalzi. This one has a very sitcom vibe - the Amazon description of _Parks and Rec_ meets _Star Trek_ is pretty accurate. 

### _**[Bookshops & Bonedust](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVKT64RG)**_ by Travis Baldree

The second entry in the award-winning cozy fantasy series was just as good as the first, and once again made a great summer road trip listen that was easy on the ears and fuzzy in the heart. Give it a listen!

### _**[Babel: Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators’ Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MD95S5V)**_ by R.F. Kuang

This was one of those books that took the internet by storm, and, of course, being in academia I had to give it a try. It definitely lived up to the hype in my opinion, and I'm curious to read more by this author in the future. 

### _**[Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX5D4LC)**_ by Matt Dinniman

My Summer 2024 was _consumed_ by the _Dungeon Crawler Carl_ series. What can I say - the audiobooks are fantastic, the story is engaging, and the characters leap out of the story as strongly as anything out there. Dinniman really caught lightning in a bottle with this one, and so far the series has not dipped in quality at all, even after 7 books. I'm just glad I was pretty much able to binge them all in one go. 

### _**[Mimic & Me](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDCM4F92)**_ by Cassius Lange & Ryan Tang

I started this series at the recommendation of a friend, and really enjoyed the first book. It is produced by many of the same folks who do _Dungeon Crawler Carl_ so the acting and voices are all top-notch. I'll probably come back around to this one once I have a free spot on my Audible queue.

### _**[Dark Lord Davi Series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH834GHK)**_ by Django Wexler

This two-entry series is a great take on the classic _Groundhog Day_ scenario: what if the hero has spent thousands of lives trying and failing to rescue the kingdom, so instead she decides to be evil for once and suddenly finds success there instead? This series has some sharp wit and adult content, but was a super fun read overall. 

### _**[Powder Mage Series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092XHPIG)**_ by Brian McClellan

This is a great blend of fantasy and military fiction with a very unique magic system concept. I really enjoyed reading through this series, and have heard that the sequel series is even better!

### _**[Not Till We Are Lost](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW2345TV)**_ by Dennis E. Taylor

The fifth book in the _Bobiverse_ series did not disappoint, with yet another unique premise and the Bob's continuing to maintain interesting characterizations and unique motivations across large spans of time and space. This series is highly recommended for anyone who loves technology, science fiction, or just imagining if the whole world was just different versions of themselves. 

### _**[Flybot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F75GJ91F)**_ by Dennis E. Taylor

A quick one-off audiobook by Taylor, this one has a really suspenseful plot combined with a fun look at some technology. I really enjoyed it as a great escape from other things, and I think it is a great new story by Taylor that is very accessible to new readers.

### _**[That's Not Right](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMWV1NVF)**_ by Scott Meyer

I immediately followed up _Flybot_ with this one, and they really went well together. A late night radio host who focuses on strange stories meets up with a young social media star who hopes to catapult him into fame and fortune, if the stories don't get the better of them while they do. A little bit _Scooby Doo_ and a little bit science fiction.

### _**[The Malevolent Seven](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BC83MRPL)**_ by Sebastien de Castell

de Castell has been one of my favorite fantasy authors for a while now, and this was the start of his newest series. I really enjoyed it as a tongue-in-cheek telling of a story of a misfit band of heroes, mages, and wizards tasked with saving the world because no one else really cares to do it. In the process, they get dragged across the world (and into the depths) while making wisecracks the whole time. 

### _**[Service Model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMYJRJPB)**_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky

Again, Tchaikovsky has a great story that builds upon a unique premise, and he even narrates this audiobook so you get his unfettered telling of it. I really enjoyed it from my experiences working with technology, and I think it is a great listen for anyone interested in robots and AI taking over the world.

### _**[Alien Clay](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLQL19D7)**_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky

Another Tchaikovsky one-off set in a very unique world. Here, the whole world is literally trying to take over the small human colony, but is that _really_ what is going on, or is there more to it? This one has great characters, a strong plot, and makes for a very captivating listen as an audiobook. Probably one of my new favorites as a one-off for folks interested in Tchaikovsky's writing style. 

### _**[Automatic Noodle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJCWQH8)**_ by Annalee Newitz

Ok, this one was completely found through advertising, so kudos to whomever pulled that off. This was a charming and cozy read about a few robots who decide to open their own restaurant serving nothing but homemade noodles. It's a quick and easy read, but leaves you with such a warm and fuzzy feeling afterward. I want more stories like this!

### _**[The Empyrean Series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV9WPS4M)**_ by Rebecca Yarros

Yeah... I couldn't resist. Everyone was reading it, so I had to check it out. The first book is great, the second book suffers from a dreaded sophomore slump but had good intentions, but by the third book I was just listening to see if I was right about where the story was headed. Will I probably listen to the next book when it comes out? ... still yeah.

### _**[Discworld Series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TYGGG76)**_ by Terry Pratchett

_Snuff_ and _Wyrd Sisters_ were the two entries in the _Discworld_ series that I got to this time around. _Snuff_ is the last of the Watch novels and a great end to that series, and the _Wyrd Sisters_ is the second entry in the Witches novels, which is really the only major thread of _Discworld_ that I haven't read much of yet. So, more of that to come!

### _**[The Contractors Series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087JJ1FL2)**_ by Andrew Ball

I mainly picked these up because I love the audiobook narrator, Luke Daniels. The first story was good, not great, but enough to get me to listen. The classic story of someone thrust into superhero-dom, only to have complications ensue. I stopped probably one third of the way through the second book and will probably leave it at that.

# Nonfiction

### _**[I'm Glad My Mom Died](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JPJ833S)**_ by Jennette Mccurdy

This was equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious. A very difficult read at times, but somewhat uplifting at the end. I'm just grateful that I really didn't identify with much that happened in this story, but I can empathize with those who have dealt with it a little bit better now.

### _**[Origins of the Wheel of Time: The Legends and Mythologies that Inspired Robert Jordan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SDZJZ9M)**_ by Michael Livingston

A great overview of the real-world inspirations and mythologies that were used by Robert Jordan in crafting his _Wheel of Time_ series. This is a great read for any fans of the book series for sure. I'm still disappointed that the TV series was cancelled right as it was hitting its stride.

# Rereads

I also did some major rereads (or re-listens) of series over the past couple of years, just to fill the time or catch up for new entries. So, you can bet if I've read it or listened to it more than once, it is _probably pretty good_ and you should check it out:

* [Bobiverse](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753LBFQ7)
* [Stormlight Archive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CBP9DY)
* [The Reckoners](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C1YZTSV)
* [Magic 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074C5BGFV)

# Notable TBR Entries

Unfortunately, because my life was in various states of chaos during the last few years, I had some instances where I started a book only to get distracted, or quickly realized that my brain just wasn't going to be able to keep up with the deeper plots and themes. Here's some notable books that I've picked up but still haven't read yet, or ones I've tried to read and had to put down. I hope to get back to all of them some day.

### _**[Fractal Noise](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGDMFG44)**_ by Christopher Paolini

I really enjoyed the first book in his _Fractalverse_ world, but I have yet to find the gumption to pick up a book of this depth in a while. It'll stay on my TBR for a bit longer.

### _**[Children of Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DN8BQMD)**_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky

I started to read _Children of Time_ right when my life got crazy, and I just couldn't stay focused enough to keep up. That said, Tchaikovsky has been one of my favorite authors over the last few years, so this one is definitely on the list of things I want to come back to once I am in the right mindset to take on such a richly detailed story.

### _**[Dead Country](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3762QDG)**_ by Max Gladstone

I absolutely _loved_ the world of Gladstone's _Craft Sequence_ when I first read it - it is truly one of the most unique and "lived in" fantasy worlds I have ever read, and I think the whole series is truly a sleeper hit that too few people have read. I am really anxious to start his follow-up series, but this one definitely requires a clear mind to be able to follow, so it'll sit on my shelf for a bit. 

### _**[Imperial Radch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3MRMF2L)**_ by Ann Leckie

I started the _Imperial Radch_ series by Ann Leckie and really loved the first book, but found the world and the writing just a bit too dense and cloudy for me to easily continue. I appreciate a good story where you have to read between the lines and find the plot within the machinations of the characters as much as anyone, but I just struggled to find the through-line of this series somewhere in the second book. I'll try to come back to it sometime. I also picked up the related novel, _Translation State_ and will try to add it to the list sometime. 

### _**[Piranesi](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084NVNFBH)**_ by Susanna Clarke

Ok, I _really_ need to give this book another chance. I listened to the audiobook while I was not feeling well, and ended up sleeping through bits and pieces of it so I really didn't get the whole plot in one go. The parts I heard were great, and the rest did the trick for allowing me a little rest when I needed it.

### _**[Sins of Empire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KT7YTV4)**_ by Brian McClellan

This is the first book in the sequel series to the **Powder Mage** series I really enjoyed, but I just wasn't able to get locked in quickly enough to keep going. I'll definitely come back around to this one sometime (now if McClellan would just keep working on the _Glass Immortals_ series, that would be nice).

### _**[Orconomics: A Satire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O2NDJ2M)**_ by J. Zachary Pike.

I really wanted to like this one, but I just kept getting lots in the plot and characters (and it could be that I was just off my game while trying to read it). It's still on my list, so I may pick it up again in the future.
