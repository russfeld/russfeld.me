My first real foray into designing my own encounter in D&D.

<!--more-->

I've been learning to be a dungeon master (DM) for D&D 5e over the past few years, mainly thanks to the tireless tutelage of my wife. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we started a new session with her family, and I was chosen to act as the DM for the campaign! It was my first solo experience, but thankfully they selected a very well written and commonly used starter adventure, [The Dragon of Icespire Peak](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/doip). So, I had some great background material to start with.

As the party slowly developed and found its own style, we quickly realized that this party would try, against all odds, to find a peaceful solution to all encounters. A couple of lucky natural 20 rolls when negotiating with a manticore early on in the game solidified this idea. Seriously, they convinced the manticore that one of our party members was his long lost master, who was very displeased with his behavior. 

Eventually, they found their way to a farmhouse that has been overrun by orcs. In the book, it literally says "the orcs are not expecting trouble, but they fight to the death." Hrm... how are we going to handle this one?

Though some sheer, dumb luck, the party was able to entreat with one of the orcs long enough to convince it that they might be able to help them out. (Ok, this is out of canon, but it works - just hear me out!) A bit of negotiation ensues, and we are off to visit the leader of the orc tribe!

My thought process after that session: _Uh oh! That's not in the book. Well, guess I better come up with something..._

I pretty quickly knew that I wanted there to be some way that our party could impress the orc tribe leader, so I pretty quickly settled on some sort of a trial of skill. But, I wasn't sure what skills to test, nor how to make it seem authentic to the story.

Enter the orc deity [Luthic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Luthic). Instead of the focus on sheer strength and chaos of most orcs, maybe a devoted follower of Luthic would find value in other traits such as intelligence, bravery, and courage? That just might work!

So, I set about coming up with some trials. After some investigation rolls online, I came up with four trials. So, below are my rough notes for how this encounter works and each of the trials. Feel free to use and adapt! 

## Setting: Orc Tribe

LThe party enters a cave and encounters **Ghorzia**, a large and intimidating female orc. She proceeds to give the party some exposition about the makeup of her tribe.

They do not follow the teachings of [Gruumsh](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gruumsh), who values chaos and destruction in the world above all else. Instead, they are followers of Luthic, the mate of Gruumsh. They believe in maintaining the cohesion of orcish society, that there needs to be some thought behind the chaos in order for it to truly succeed and the gods to be pleased. The strong woman standing behind the man, so to speak.

Recently many of the other tribes were forced from their homes in the mountains. This tribe took the lost bands in and offered to help them find new places where they could live. However, now that those bands are constantly threatening humans, they are afraid that Neverwinter will send troops to quell them. While the males want a fight, this tribe knows it would be suicidal, and they want to find a way to fix this to rebuild their numbers.

Long ago they discovered this magical cave full of mysteries, and their greatest leaders proved themselves by entering and completing the trials. All males who try come back humiliated and ashamed. If the party can prove their worth by completing the trials, she'll listen to your request. She has very little confidence that the party will succeed.

_I took some loose inspiration from the Aes Sedai and Aiel trials in Wheel of Time, among others, for this part._
