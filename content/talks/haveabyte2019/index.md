### Draft Script (Will Be Updated After Event)

Good Afternoon! My name is Russell Feldhausen, and I'm an instructor in the K-State Computer Science department. A little over a year ago, I was contacted by Dr. DeLoach, the computer science department head, to help solve an interesting problem...

<slide - problem>

Previously, our department has offered a computer science minor to any students who wish to learn programming without majoring in CS. However, the minor consists of the same classes that our majors take, and with our recent growth, we were simply unable to find many seats in those classes for students wishing to complete the minor. So, very few did.

At the same time, we started anticipating a massive increase in the number of students who would need Computer Science skills in the modern workplace. I might be a bit biased, but I like to think of computer science in much the same way as we think of Math and English today - it is a core skill that it useful for everyone, and pretty soon it will be one of those things that is just a normal part of every major.

<appear text>

We started to ask ourselves: "how can we provide CS courses to a rapidly growing number of non-CS majors, all with our department's limited resources?" Of course, if resources weren't a problem, we'd just go out and hire 5 new faculty and teach more sections of our existing courses. That's easy to do, right?

<slide - galaxy>

No, we needed to think a bit more outside the box. We really wanted to come up with an entirely new approach for these classes, one that hasn't been done in our department before.

<appear text>

I've always been a fan of this quote from Carl Sagan: "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe." To me, this tells us that we must completely rethink the way we look at education, and challenge our assumptions of why things are done the way they are.

My thinking was helped along a bit by a session at a computer science educators conference. The premise was simple - break up into groups, and reimagine how you would rebuild an educational system from the ground up after a world ending catastrophe. In my group, we tried to imagine the ideal educational scenario - the best possible way to educate someone to mastery, without any regard to prior structures, scale, or time.

<slide - panda>

Very quickly, we realized that the ideal form of education is embodied in the media all the time - it is the world renowned master teaching a single pupil until that pupil is a master. It's as simple as that. If we think back, we even realize that our own history has this as the basic model - the days of apprentice silversmiths or shipwrights learning the trade from a master artisan.

So, once we've identified the ideal, how can we explain what our current educational system has become?

<slide - simpsons>

In effect, we can simply consider it as a scalability problem. As we try to teach more and more students, we have to make tradeoffs. So, to really build a quality educational experience, we simply need to solve the scalability problem in a way that maximizes educational quality while still teaching many students in a cost effective way.

<appear text>

As a computer scientist, I love scalability problems.

<slide - traditional approach>

So, here's the traditional approach to scalability in education. We start with the ideal situation of having just a few students. In that case, we can teach using small lessons, give instant feedback, customize the lessons to meet the needs of our students, spend more of our time as teachers developing quality materials and engaging with our students, and focus on teaching individual skills to our students. Sounds great, right? Whenever I've been lucky enough to have small classes, I've always been excited to teach since it is easier for me to do these things and feel like I'm providing a good experience to my students.

<appear text>

When we scale up to a larger class, we have to adapt our approach. This leads to large classes, students having to turn in work and wait for a week or more to get feedback, the use of published textbooks that may not exactly fit the class's needs, teachers spending time lecturing and grading instead of developing new materials, and a focus on exams and credit hours as the measure of student learning. Sound familiar? I taught the introductory CS course for several years, and faced each of these problems head-on as the course ballooned from 80 students a semester to over 200.

<slide - lecture>

So, let's take a large class make it available online. Look familiar? To me, this is what happens when we try to apply our traditional model of scalability to online learning. We have long lectures, usually recorded from the back of a on-campus version of the class, since the instructor doesn't really have time to give the lecture yet another time, and it feels more familiar to lecture in front of students anyway. The online students do the same homework, wait the same amount of time for feedback, and in some cases can feel like second-class citizens, especially if the course is offered both online and on campus. I know - I've been there.

<slide - online approach>

Can we do better? What if we ignore the traditional model for scalability...

<appear text>

...and instead try to bring along all of the good attributes from a small class and apply it to large, online classes using technology and state of the art online learning?

<slide - codio>

That's the model we are striving to build. We're creating a set of 5 new courses, completely online, which will make up a new undergraduate certificate in computer science. These courses have been developed from the ground up to use state of the art online learning environments to teach computer science while remaining highly scalable. For example, many of the courses will use the Codio learning environment, seen here. Students can follow along with written tutorials on the right, and even watch short explainer videos recorded by faculty in a purpose-built recording studio. Then, on the left, they can follow along and write the code right there in their browser, testing and debugging until they get it right.

<slide - small lessons>

We can then focus on teaching skills not as a single omnibus lecture, but as a module that consists of many small lessons. Students can come and go at any time, and work on as few or as many lessons as they'd like. The course is designed to be flexible and approachable to students working full time, part time, or on nights and weekends. The only deadline is that they must complete at least 1 module per week, just so they don't fall too far behind in the course.

<slide - instant feedback>

Since we are teaching programming, we can use those same tools to provide instant feedback to the student. In that way, a student can continually develop, test, and debug their code using the same tests that will be used to grade their submission. Computer programming is uniquely well suited to this approach, and it allows students to get instant feedback on their work anytime. This iterative approach to learning has been shown to be powerful, since students can instantly go back and learn from their mistakes.

<slide - develop engage>

By using these online tools, we can create a set of 5 courses that are supported by just two full-time faculty, who spend a majority of their time developing new teaching materials and engaging directly with students. Instead of giving the same lecture 24 times in 4 years, I can give it just once in front of a camera, get it right, and then provide it to students for years to come. We are also able to make use of GTAs and UTAs to help answer questions and hold office hours, giving those students a great opportunity to learn by teaching others. It is really a win-win for us.

<slide - custom curricula>

Since we are building these courses from scratch, we're able to customize the curricula to fit our students needs even better. Since we recognize that some students may want to take multiple courses in a semester, we're already making plans for how students could effectively take any combination of courses simultaneously.

<slide - skills>

We can do this by focusing the course prerequisites around individual skills instead of entire courses. For example, in a later course, we could teach students how to use a list to sort data. That skill requires students to know the basics of the language, loops, if statements, and lists, but the student may not need to know inheritance, polymorphism, or recursion. Traditionally, students would have to complete an entire course before starting the next one, but in this case, they just have to complete the prerequisite modules to move ahead in a later course.

<slide - canvas>

And we can do this today, using the modules and prerequisites structure built in to Canvas! It isn't as clean and straightforward as we'd like, but it allows us to explore these novel models of education right away.

<slide - capstone>

Finally, students who complete this certificate will do a capstone project to link their programming skill back to their discipline and interest. Through their project, they'll demonstrate the ability to identify a real world problem, choose the appropriate data structures and algorithms to address that problem, implement the software to match their specification, and then debug and test the software to show that it works as intended. So, at the end, we can still achieve the desired learning outcomes through the meaningful use of faculty time to supervise this project. We can even reach out to colleagues on campus and partner with them to provide projects that fit a student's declared major.

<slide - available>

Sound exciting? This program is available now to any students at K-State who wish to add programming to their list of skills. Currently the program consists of 4 courses and 14 credits, with a 5th course coming in Fall 2020. We teach using the Java and Python programming languages, and each course is specifically designed for non-CS majors. As an added bonus, we can even offer a free trial, just so students, faculty and advisors can experience the course firsthand before deciding to enroll.

<slide - future>

Lastly, this approach to developing new courses has opened up a wide range of possible future plans. We're currently working with the College of Arts & Sciences to explore ways to expand these courses into a full Applied Computer Science degree program, combining Arts & Sciences disciplines with computer programming. We hope to provide these courses as curricula for high schools in Kansas who are in desperate need of quality CS education and teachers qualified to teach it. We can offer these courses to industry partners looking for professional development opportunities for staff. We can even expand the courses to cover more languages, deeper topics, and other disciplines. So stay tuned! Hopefully we'll have more exiting things to announce in the near future.

<slide - end>

For now, if you are interested in these courses, feel free to sign up for our free trial by following this QR code link. You can also find it by following either of the links under more information. I'd love to chat with anyone who is interested in these courses or how we are approaching the development of this program. I've only scratched the surface here. You can find these slides on my website linked at the top, and I can be found on most social media as russfeld.

Thank you!
