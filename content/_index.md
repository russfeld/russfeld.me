### Current Work

I'm currently working on creating a new [online certificate and BA program](https://global.k-state.edu/engineering/computer-science/) for K-State Computer Science. The first course will be available Fall 2019, with many courses online by Fall 2020.

I am also teaching a few online courses, including my [Enterprise Systems Administration](https://cis527.russfeld.me/) class once again.

Finally, I'm working on my PhD research, hopefully to be completed by Spring 2021.
