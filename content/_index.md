I teach [Computer Science](https://cs.ksu.edu) at [Kansas State University](https://ksu.edu), focusing in teaching and developing online courses for our [Computational Core](http://www.cs.ksu.edu/core/) program. Those courses are used in our [online certificate and B.A. programs](https://global.k-state.edu/engineering/computer-science/). We also hope to extend those courses to other audiences, such as high schools, partner institutions, and industry partners.

I am also a Ph.D. student focusing in Computer Science Education research. The bulk of my research consists of examining the educational outcomes of our online programs.
