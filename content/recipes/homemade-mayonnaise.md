[Homemade hamburger](/blog/homemade-hamburgers/) step 5 - the sauce!

<!--more-->

When I said I wanted to make _everything_ myself, even the mayo was needed. I didn't know it was so easy, but now that I've done it, I can't see myself going back.

### Ingredients
+ 1 egg -or- 4 oz Egg Beaters (pasteurized egg substitute)
+ 1 tbsp lemon juice (1/2 lemon)
+ 1 tsp dijon mustard
+ 1 medium clove garlic, microplaned
+ 1 cup vegetable or canola oil
+ ***seasonings***
  + kosher salt
  + pepper
  + olive oil
  + herbs (optional)
  + sugar (optional)
  + apple cider vinegar (optional)

### Equipment
+ immersion blender
+ tall cup (make sure the blender fits all the way to the bottom)

### Process
1. Add egg, lemon juice, dijon mustard, and garlic to cup.
2. Gently pour oil on top of the ingredients.
3. Gingerly insert the immersion blender all the way to the bottom of the cup, careful not to disturb the oil.
4. Turn on the blender, and slowly move it upward as the mixture emulsifies.
5. Transfer to a bowl, season to taste, and whisk briskly to combine.

### Notes
2017-03-11 - First try wasn't bad, but the recipe I followed called for way too much olive oil. I need to continue experimenting.  
2017-07-09 - After a bit of practice, very easy to do. Can use Egg Beaters if you want them to be pasteurized. I started playing around with flavors, adding herbs, sugar, and vinegars to get different flavors. Definitely recommend playing around with these.
