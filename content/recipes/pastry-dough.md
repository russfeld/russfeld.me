A quick and easy to make pastry dough recipe for pies and more!

Here's the pastry dough recipe that I used for these [cornish pasties](/recipes/cornish-pasties).

Original source: [epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pastry-dough-356091)

### Ingredients
+ 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
+ 1 stick **cold** unsalted butter
+ 1/4 tsp. salt
+ 3 - 5 tbsp. **ice cold** water

### Equipment
+ medium bowl
+ coarse cheese grater
+ silicone pastry mat
+ rolling pin
+ plastic wrap

### Setup
1. Lightly flour pastry mat

### Process
1. Blend together flour, butter and salt. I like to use a course cheese grater to grate the butter into nice, manageable pieces, stirring into the flour every once in a while as I grate. If you coat the butter in flour first it won't melt as quickly in your hand either. You may have to use your fingers to deal with a few larger chunks at the end.
2. Add 3 tbsp of water to the mix and gently stir to combine.
3. Try to squeeze a bit of it together and see if it holds. If not, add more water 1/2 tbsp at a time until it does. It doesn't all have to be held together at this point.
4. Put dough on lightly floured surface and gently work it in a smearing/kneading fashion until it comes together. Do not overwork dough as it becomes tough. Should only take 3-4 motions. Try not to allow dough to warm up too much as it will melt the butter.
5. Scrape together dough into a disk about 5 inches across, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill at least one hour. Can be chilled up to 3 days before use.

### Notes
* 2016-12-09 - This recipe worked really well for the [cornish pasties](/recipes/cornish-pasties). It took about 6 recipes of this dough for 3 times that recipe. I made the dough in double sized batches and it worked well.
