### Ingredients
+ 1 cup warm water
+ 2 tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)
+ 3 tbsp warm milk
+ 2 1/2 tbsp sugar
+ 2 large eggs
+ 3 cups bread flour
+ 1/3 cup AP flour
+ 1 1/2 tsp salt
+ 2 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, very cold
+ sesame seeds (optional)

### Equipment
+ large mixing bowl
+ baking sheet
+ large shallow pan
+ box grater

### Process
1. Combine yeast, water, milk, and sugar in a glass bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Use the box grater to grate the butter into the flour to make crumbs.
3. Add 1 beaten egg and yeast mixture, stir to combine into a dough.
4. Put dough on lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, usually 8 minutes or so. The dough should be a bit tacky, but try to minimize the amount of flour used.
5. Shape dough back into a ball and put in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until doubled. Usually 1 - 2 hours.

6. Divide into 8 equal parts, shape into a bun, and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover again with plastic wrap sprayed with non-stick spray and let rise for another 1 - 2 hours.
7. Preheat oven to 400&deg;F. Place a large shallow pan of water on a rack in the bottom position of the oven.
8. Combine the remaining egg, beaten, with 1 tbsp water and brush on top of each bun. Add sesame seeds (if using).

9. Bake, turning baking sheet halfway through, for 15 minutes or until golden brown.

### Notes
* 2017-03-11 - Not too bad. Not exactly what I was looking for, but good nonetheless. Was hoping for something a bit less dense and a bit sweeter. The quest is still on to find the perfect bun!
