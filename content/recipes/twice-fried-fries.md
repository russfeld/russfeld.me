[Homemade hamburger](/blog/homemade-hamburgers/) step 3 - gotta have fries!

What's a great burger without great fries? I love the rosemary, parmesan and truffle oil combo of these fries. Very aromatic and equally delicious.

### Ingredients
+ 2 lb. russet potatoes
+ 2 tbsp distilled white vinegar
+ 2 quarts peanut oil
+ ***seasonings***
  + salt
  + pepper
  + rosemary
  + freshly grated parmesan

### Equipment
+ large dutch oven
+ metal strainer or spider
+ high temperature thermometer

### Process
1. Peel and cut the potatoes into 1/4 inch strips. Store the potatoes in water until you are ready to boil them.

2. Combine two quarts water, 2 tbsp salt and 2 tbsp vinegar in a large pot. Add potatoes, then bring to boil. Cook for 10 minutes until potatoes are tender but not falling apart.
3. Remove potatoes from water, allow to dry on a towel-lined baking sheet for at least 5 minutes.
4. Heat oil in large dutch oven over high heat to 400&deg;F. Add 1/3 of fries to oil, it should drop to around 360&deg;F. Cook for 50 seconds, stirring very lightly to avoid sticking. Drain on another towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat for other two batches of fries.
  + *WARNING!* Be very careful at this step. I nearly had a grease fire on my hands as the oil bubbled over when I added the first batch of fries too quickly.
5. Allow potatoes to cool for at least 30 minutes. You can freeze potatoes at this step for up to 2 months.
6. Reheat oil to 400&deg;F. Add 1/2 of potatoes to oil and fry for 3 1/2 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Try to maintain oil at 360&deg;F during frying. Drain on a towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat for other half of fries.
7. Toss with salt, rosemary, pepper, and top with parmesan.

### Notes
2017-03-11 - Delicious! Not nearly worth the effort when McDonald's does it for just a couple bucks, but nice to know that you _can_ do it at home if you want! :^)
