My take on the classic tuna salad. An all-time favorite

<!--more-->

Tuna salad has been a quick and easy comfort food for me for a long time. The addition of apples gives it a fresh and crisp flavor.

### Ingredients
+ 1 can tuna in water
+ 1 small onion, finely chopped
+ 1 honeycrisp apple, cored and julienned (can use a mandolin)
+ 1/2 cup vegetables, finely chopped
  + carrots
  + celery
  + bell peppers
  + *can use whatever is on hand*
+ 6 oz. mayonnaise
+ 1 tbsp. deli mustard
+ 1 tbsp. sweet pickle relish
+ 1 hard boiled egg, finely chopped (optional)
+ ***seasonings***
  + salt & pepper
  + garlic

### Equipment
+ medium bowl
+ julienne mandolin slicer (optional)
+ cutting board & knife

### Setup
none

### Process
1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir. Season to taste.
2. Serve on a bun or bread. I like to add a pickle.

### Notes
2016-12-10 - Yummy as always! I used a finer julienne on the apple this time and it released a bit more juice than I'd like. Probably will stick to the slightly larger size.
