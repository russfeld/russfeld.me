### Ingredients
+ 1 large head green cabbage, finely shredded
+ 1 large red onion, finely sliced
+ 1 large carrot, grated on a box grater
+ 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves
+ 1 cup sugar
+ 1/2 cup kosher salt
+ ***dressing***
  + 3/4 cup [mayonnaise](/recipes/homemade-mayonnaise)
  + 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
  + 2 tbsp dijon mustard
  + 1 tbsp pepper
  + 3 tbsp sugar

### Equipment
+ large colander
+ large bowl

### Process
1. Combine cabbage, carrot, parsley, salt and sugar in large colander. Let it rest for 30 minutes to remove moisture.
2. Whisk together dressing ingredients until well combined. Adjust ratios to taste.
3. Combine dressing and veggies. Toss to coat.

### Notes
2017-03-11 - Works pretty well. The original recipe I had didn't add so much sugar, and I thought it was not sweet enough. This one should be much better!
