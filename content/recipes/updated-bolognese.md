ingredients:
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped (optional - this makes it really spicy)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced or microplaned
- 1 tbsp butter or olive oil
- 2 large cans San Marzano style tomatoes
- 1-2 lb. ground italian sausage (I usually get mild or medium, but you can crank up the heat here too)
- 1/2-1 cup chicken stock (optional - if you want the sauce a little mellower and not as thick)
- sugar to taste (to help cut the acidity)
- salt
- pepper
- oregano
- thyme
- basil
- red pepper flakes
- fennel seeds
- garlic powder
- onion powder

directions:
- In dutch oven or separate skillet, brown the meat until cooked, trying to get just a bit of dark brown color in a few spots for extra flavor.
- Heat butter or oil in dutch oven until shimmering (or just use the juices from the meat). Add onion, carrots, celery, and peppers, and cook until softened, about 5-10 minutes.
- Add garlic, cook until aromatic, about 1 minute.
- In a separate bowl, crush the tomatoes by hand, pulling out any hard bits from the core. Add to dutch oven, along with the stock (if using).
- Bring to boil, then turn down the heat and let simmer until it gets a nice, rich and dark red color (you'll know when you see it). Usually takes 30 minutes to 1 hour - the longer the better. I usually get the sauce going before I start rolling out my [homemade pasta](/recipes/homemade-pasta/).
- Season to taste as it cooks. Usually doesn't need much salt at all, but I like to add quite a few dried herbs, red pepper flakes to adjust heat, and fennel seeds for a unique flavor if the sausage doesn't include them. You can also integrate in a few fresh herbs as well, but they aren't necessary for great tasting sauce. Add sugar a tablespoon at a time, only to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.

This is a powerfully delicious red sauce, which can be made powerfully spicy as well.

I've slowly improvised on several of my recipes, and my [bolognese sauce](/recipes/bolognese/) is one that has changed the most, probably because I long since stopped actually reading the recipe when I make it!

So, here's my best guess at what my median recipe would be for this new version. Enjoy!

Marinara sauce - omit the meat and chicken stock. Once it is ready, use a blender to blend it into a thick sauce to use as either a pizza sauce or dipping sauce, or serve with pasta for a smoother sauce experience.

Serve with _lots_ of freshly grated parmesan, romano, asiago, or other hard aged cheese.
