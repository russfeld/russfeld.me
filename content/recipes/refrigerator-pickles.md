These are the pickles that make my mouth water every time I think about them. They are so quick and easy, and usually don't last long in my fridge!

(My mom actually has had the clipping from the issue this was printed in for years!)

### Ingredients
+ 3 cucumbers, 1/4 inch thick slices
+ 1 white onion, thinly sliced
+ 3 tbsp kosher salt
+ crushed ice
+ 1 1/2 cups sugar
+ 1 1/2 cups cider vinegar
+ 1 tbsp mustard seeds
+ 1 tsp celery seeds
+ small unpeeled ginger root, cut into 1/4 inch slices (usually 4-5 slices)

### Equipment
+ large non-reactive pot
+ colander
+ large bowl
+ heavy plate

### Process
1. Toss cucumbers, onion and salt. Put in a colander inside a bowl, layered with ice. Weight down with a heavy place, and chill overnight, up to 24 hours.

2. Meanwhile, combine sugar, vinegar, seeds and ginger in non-reactive pot. Bring to boil, then simmer for 3 minutes. Cool and refrigerate.
3. Once cucumbers are ready, remove unmelted ice and discard liquid. Add to large non-reactive pot. Strain sugar and vinegar mixture over cucumbers.
4. Heat to a low boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. Store in clean glass container in the fridge for a couple of weeks, or store in properly sealed canning jars in the fridge for longer periods.

### Notes
2017-03-11 - Good as always! I made a smaller batch this time, about half what the original recipe calls for. Worked great!
