As I've started making more and more homemade food, I've taken a hard look at what I cook to try and find ways I can make it better. One thing I noticed was that all my homemade pasta deserved a nice, homemade sauce to go along with it. Enter my version of bolognese.

I know, I know, it isn't [real bolognese](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/12/the-food-lab-slow-cooked-bolognese-sauce-recipe.html), but it isn't just everyday tomato sauce either. I think this fits somewhere in-between, and it is my go-to sauce whenever I make homemade pasta.

Update 2018-03-03: This is a recipe I constantly improvise on, and the version I've settled on is a bit different than what I have posted here. Click here for my [better bolognese sauce](/recipes/better-bolognese/)
