### Ingredients
+ 6 - 8 lb. pork shoulder (Boston butt roast), cut into 2-3 in. pieces
+ 2 onions, chopped
+ 2 cloves garlic, crushed
+ 2 tbsp. olive oil
+ 2 32 oz. containers chicken broth
+ 1/4 cup lime juice
+ ***seasonings:***
  + salt & pepper
  + cumin
  + chili powder
  + oregano
  + thyme
  + dried yellow mustard

### Equipment
+ large skillet
+ dutch oven
+ cutting board & knife

### Setup
none

### Process
1. Heat oil in skillet and brown all sides of each piece of meat.
2. Combine all ingredients except broth in dutch oven. I usually do 1 tbsp. chili powder and cumin to 1 tsp. other seasonings
3. Add broth until ingredients are mostly covered.
4. Heat to boiling, then simmer for up to 3 hours.
5. Remove from pan and place on cutting board. Shred pork between two forks.
6. Optional: Can bake in 400&deg;F oven for 20-30 minutes until browned further.

### Notes
2016-12-12 - Made really delicious burritos and nachos for Monday Night. I saved the broth to use as a chili base later this winter
