Homemade pasta is the hallmark of good Italian cuisine.

<!--more-->

One of the things that got me started as a serious cook was my love for pasta. I wanted to know the secrets to making my own, homemade pasta. After a bit of practice (and some equipment upgrades), I can make it without really thinking about it. It is a lot of work compared to boiling the dried stuff, and it isn't nearly as cheap, so I list this as a _sometimes_ food, but _sometimes_ it is worth the effort. You can even infuse it with herbs such as basil, as in the picture below.

### Ingredients
+ 1 cup AP flour (I've heard that 00 flour is better, but haven't tried it)
+ 1 cup semolina flour
+ 2 whole eggs
+ 4 egg yolks
+ 1 tbsp olive oil (I prefer the Tuscan herb infused oil from [Heavenly Olive Oils](https://www.heavenlyoliveoils.com/))
+ 1 tsp salt
+ 1-2 tbsp water (if needed)

### Equipment
+ stand mixer with paddle and dough hook
+ pasta roller attachments for mixer (or a hand-cranked pasta roller)

### Process
1. Add all ingredients except water to bowl of stand mixer. Beat on low speed with paddle until combined well. Add water 1 tbsp at a time if needed to get ingredients to combine.
2. Switch to dough hook and knead on medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes. It will be a very stiff ball of dough, but it should knead without too much trouble.
3. Put dough on lightly-floured surface and knead for 5-8 minutes until smooth and slightly elastic. It will be tough, but the drier your dough, the better it works.
4. Put dough in a bowl and let it rest for at least 30 minutes, and ideally 1 hour.
5. Split dough into 4 equal parts. Working one part at a time, roll through pasta roller.
  + Start at widest setting and roll 6-8 times, folding over 3 times and rotating 90 degrees after each roll until dough becomes a smooth sheet. Add flour as needed to keep things from sticking. More flour is better than less at this point.
  + Slowly adjust roller to progressively smaller settings. If needed. cut sheet in half to make it more manageable.
  + Once all sheets are made, switch to cutting attachments and cut into noodles. Form a floured nest with each set of noodles.
6. To cook, boil 3-4 quarts of water with _lOTS_ of salt (you want it to be "salty as the sea"). Add noodles (the extra flour on the noodles will wash away) and boil 90 seconds to 3 minutes. *It doesn't take too long for homemade noodles, even if they are dried and frozen.*

I recommend serving with a nice [bolognese sauce](/recipes/bolognese/)! Or maybe even a [better bolognese sauce](/recipes/better-bolognese/)!

### Notes
2016-02-20 - Infusing with basil herbs works great. Infusing with sun-dried tomatoes and red peppers from a jar didn't work as well. Too much moisture in both, so probably should adjust amounts accordingly to get a solid dough. But, it was tasty!
